# Larave blogging site (Lara)

-   This project is based as a clone of blogging site [Dev](https://www.dev.to).
-   Whole project is buildet with php framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) with [Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze) starter kit
-   It's not my goal to make perfetct copy of Dev.to, but only to create basic functionality of this site to get better at working with Laravel
